# ðŸ§  Personality Traits Analysis

## Project Overview

This project conducts **Exploratory Data Analysis EDA** and initial modeling preparation on a dataset focused on **personality traits** specifically distinguishing between **Extroverts and Introverts**

The goal is to analyze behavioral metrics like social activity and solitary time to understand how they correlate with an individuals personality type

The core analysis is performed and documented in the **personality_traitsipynb** Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset and Data Dictionary

The analysis uses a dataset loaded from **personality_datasetcsv** It contains 2900 rows and 8 columns of behavioral data

| Column Name | Description | Example Values |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Time_spent_Alone** | The amount of time spent in solitary activities | 00 to 110 |
| **Stage_fear** | Indicates presence of stage or public speaking anxiety | Yes No |
| **Social_event_attendance** | Frequency or measure of attending social gatherings | 00 to 100 |
| **Drained_after_socializing** | Whether socializing results in mental fatigue | Yes No |

## Analysis Highlights from Notebook

The notebook **personality_traitsipynb** performs these essential data science steps

* **Data Loading** The dataset of 2900 samples was loaded
* **Missing Value Check** The statistical summary shows columns like **Friends_circle_size** have missing values that need handling before modeling
* **Initial Exploration** The analysis includes basic descriptive statistics to understand the central tendency and spread of numerical features
